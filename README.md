# ODOTS-Interface
ODOTS Interface Source Code, a frozen version of this application (for windows) is available in the [ODOTS Release repository](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release). Currently no other platforms are supported, though changing this is mainly a case of changing the directory path names and the serial port handling.

## Further Documentation

Full software documentation and detailed descriptions of the interfaces between the application supplied here and the rest of the ODOTS project can be found in the current [Specification and User Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/master/docs/ODOTSManualAndUserGuide.pdf), supplied in the [ODOTS-Release Repository](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/).
